# modern-js-starter
Recently I was excited about modern javascript. So I was working with Todd Motto's basic javascript course. 
I found this as a starter project but saw that most of the packages are outdated.
So I thought to upgrade all the packages up to date.
I had to change lot of configurations to make this work.
If you are into ES6, Babel, EsLint this will provide a good start point.
